## Outline:
#### Introduction ###
The goal of this collaborative group project is to create a test database for a campus-operated food delivery service, based on the already existing Crave On Campus company. The database will catalog people, locations, drivers, deliveries, food providers, and other entities, and will also factor in the relationships between entities. The result of this project will be a fully normalized database, which is created with consideration to business rules, entity relationship diagrams, normalization and schema design. This database will be presented through a narrated PowerPoint presentation that explains the database and its features, along with an SQL dump of the database. This README.md provides a table of contents for the project and is split into categories based on topic.

#### Use Case

A customer can place an order at a restaurant and make a payment. A staff member creates the order and notifies the delivery person once it is ready. The driver picks up the food and delivers it to the customer. The customer can rate the driver and give any feedback they would like once the food is delivered. A new staff member can be added to the delivery service by the manager. The manager can also update staff information.
